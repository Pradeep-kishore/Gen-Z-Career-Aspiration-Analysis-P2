# Gen-Z-Career-Aspiration-Analysis-P2
This is my internship project where I analyzed Gen Z's career aspirations using SQL for data cleaning and Excel for dashboard creation. It provides insights into work preferences, company types, salary expectations, and more, helping businesses understand Gen Zâ€™s professional goals and improve their strategies.
